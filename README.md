## Overview

avel is a library of functions I created to help make automated video editing and generation a little easier. It supports trimming, combining video clips with different dimensions, adding text overlays, merging audio, and more.

## Dependencies

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Ensure that both 'ffmpeg' and 'ffprobe' are available from the command line.
